      notes: "Creates comprehensive PRD focused on UI enhancement with existing system analysis. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      uses: front-end-spec-tmpl
      requires: prd.md
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification that integrates with existing design patterns. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

      creates: story.md
      requires: sharded_docs
      repeats: for_each_epic
      notes: |
        Story creation cycle:
        - SM Agent (New Chat): @sm → *create
        - Creates next story from sharded docs
        - Story starts in "Draft" status

    - agent: analyst/pm

        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Implements approved story
        - Updates File List with all changes
        - Marks story as "Review" when complete

    - agent: qa

      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
        - Fixes small issues directly
        - Leaves checklist for remaining items
        - Updates story status (Review → Done or stays Review)

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - step: repeat_development_cycle
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic stories
        Continue until all stories in PRD are complete

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - UI enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Design system changes needed
      - New component patterns required
      - User research and testing needed
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes
