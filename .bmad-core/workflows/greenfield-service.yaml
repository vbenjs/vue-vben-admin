    Agent workflow for building backend services from concept to development.
    Supports both comprehensive planning for complex services and rapid prototyping for simple APIs.
  type: greenfield
  project_types:
    - rest-api
    - graphql-api
    - microservice
    - backend-service
    - api-prototype
    - simple-service

  sequence:
    - agent: analyst
      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl, focused on API/service requirements. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: architect
      creates: architecture.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates backend/service architecture using architecture-tmpl. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: architecture.md
      condition: architecture_suggests_prd_changes
      notes: "If architect suggests story changes, update PRD and re-export the complete unredacted prd.md to docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for consistency and completeness. May require updates to any document."

      action: shard_documents
      creates: sharded_docs
      requires: all_artifacts_in_project
      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

      action: create_story
      creates: story.md
      requires: sharded_docs
      repeats: for_each_epic
      notes: |
        Story creation cycle:
        - SM Agent (New Chat): @sm → *create
        - Creates next story from sharded docs
        - Story starts in "Draft" status

    - agent: analyst/pm
      action: review_draft_story
      updates: story.md
      requires: story.md
      optional: true
      condition: user_wants_story_review
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: Review and approve draft story
        - NOTE: story-review task coming soon
        - Review story completeness and alignment
        - Update story status: Draft → Approved

    - agent: dev
      action: implement_story
      creates: implementation_files
      requires: story.md
      notes: |
        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Implements approved story
        - Updates File List with all changes
        - Marks story as "Review" when complete

    - agent: qa
      action: review_implementation
      updates: implementation_files
      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
        - Fixes small issues directly
        - Leaves checklist for remaining items
        - Updates story status (Review → Done or stays Review)

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - step: repeat_development_cycle
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic stories
        Continue until all stories in PRD are complete

    - agent: po
      action: epic_retrospective
      creates: epic-retrospective.md
      condition: epic_complete
      optional: true

        OPTIONAL: After epic completion
        - NOTE: epic-retrospective task coming soon
        - Validate epic was completed correctly
        - Document learnings and improvements

    - step: workflow_end

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Building production APIs or microservices
      - Multiple endpoints and complex business logic
      - Need comprehensive documentation and testing
      - Multiple team members will be involved
      - Long-term maintenance expected
      - Enterprise or external-facing APIs
