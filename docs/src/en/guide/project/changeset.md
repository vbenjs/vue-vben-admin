# Changeset

The project has integrated [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) as a version management tool. Changeset is a version management tool that helps us better manage versions, generate changelogs, and automate releases.

For detailed usage, please refer to the official documentation. If you do not need it, you can ignore it directly.

## Command Line

The changeset command is already built into the project:

### Interactively Add Changesets

```bash
pnpm run changeset
```

### Uniformly Increment Version Numbers

```bash
pnpm run version
```
